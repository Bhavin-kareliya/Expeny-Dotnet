        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Expense management is a multi-step process that includes capturing and submitting expenses, which can involve: submitting reimbursement claims, approving or denying those claims, scheduling the claims for payment, and, finally, reimbursing the employee.

With the right process in place, companies can monitor their spending, ensure employees aren’t abusing the system, and take quick corrective action if they are (e.g., letting individual employees know that they’re spending more than they should be in specific areas). If, for example, a salesperson has been flying first class without prior approval to do so, a quick check of his or her receipts will reveal the violation.

It can be difficult to find these issues with manual systems, particularly for a company with a growing team of field workers. Missing information, approval of spending without a thorough review and slow approvals are all common issues. This not only wastes employees’ time but also leaves employees wondering where their expense checks are (often as they’re already racking up new expenses for the next closing period).
